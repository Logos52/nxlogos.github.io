                <div class="post-content">
                    <p><img src="./assets/images/irrationality/hippasus.jpg" alt="Hippasus" style="margin-top: 0.4em;" class="align-left" />We begin with a tragic tale, the story of Hippasus<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.  The story is well known among the mathematics circles.  Hippasus lived in the 5th century BCE who belonged to a religious sect called the <em>Pythagoreans</em>, who believed that rational numbers are the heart of the universe.  <em>All is number</em>, was their motto.  Numbers were at the heart of the divine <em>rational</em> truth, and Pythagoreans believed they were sacred, <em>rational</em> things, that held together the cosmos.</p>

<p>Then came Hippasus, a follower and practitioner of this religion.  He was able to solve the mystery of the diagonal of the square.  If you take a square, each with sides 1, the diagonal will be \(\sqrt{2}\).</p>

<p>Note, \(\sqrt{2}\) is the first irrational number in existence to be proved, and the pythagoreans, while based on a mathematical religion, is still a religion, with belief systems.  The discovery and existence of an irrational number was considered a form of heresy and a threat to the core of the Pythagoreans, who’s power and influence stemmed from their belief that rational numbers are sacred.  Instead of being rewarded for his discovery, he was murdered.. thrown into the open sea by his sect-mates.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This serves as a cautionary tale for anyone who is interested in the study of rationality, as well as science.  The world has many of these dark twins… a light and a darkness. One cannot exist without the other.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the best way to study science, you must acknowledge its dark sides, and go to places that even science does not care to look. In pursuit for the never-ending quest for truth, scientists often turn a blind eye to threats to its existence.</p>

<p>In truth, science suffers from the same confirmation bias that antiscience does. They will discuss among themselves how wrong and misguided the other side is. When there is no shared ground, when science does not include everyone, lines will be drawn.</p>

<p>To the person on the fringes, science is the enemy. It’s the teacher that gave you a ‘D’ in math. It’s the exclusionary Ivy-League elite universities. ‘Only the smart study here. You don’t study here, so what are you?’</p>

<p>Any isolated person that finds themselves disenfranchised will find company in each other. Movements will build, communities will form, and they, like any community, will take to the streets and fight for their survival.</p>

<p>History is filled with examples of this: the burning of the library at Alexandria, the ending of the Islamic scientific Golden Age, the 800 years of what we call the Dark Ages… Science has encountered massive destruction in it’s history.  Knowledge gained, and knowledge lost.</p>

<p>When a belief system ignores the outside world, that belief system will suffer the inevitable fate of becoming consumed by it.</p>

<p>It is hubris to think that we are immune from the sins of the past, for we are all humans, no different from our ancestors, complete with the same emotions, cognitive bias, and belief systems. Things that have happened, will happen again…</p>

      <p>I first heard of this story after reading Irrationality: The Dark Side of Reason, by Justin E.H. Smith.  It’s a solid read that explains how our pursuit of rationality often unconvers its opposite. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>It should be noted the actual details from story of Hippasus are subject of historical debate.  This is legend, and, like other legends, begins with some basis in truth, but becomes distorted over each telling of the story, like a game of telephone.  Among contemporary mathematicians it is a well-known tale, the origins of which can be traced back to the Pythagoreans themselves. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
