                    <h2 id="protagoras--the-sophists">Protagoras &amp; the Sophists</h2>

<p><img src="./assets/images/irrationality/chess.jpg" alt="Chess" class="align-left" />In the 5th century BCE, Greece was populated by <em>sophists</em>: people  trained in the art of persuasion and influence.  They are often paid large sums of money by politicians and leaders, in order to teach them the ways and methods on how to effectively command and influence others.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/irrationality/wrestlers.jpg" alt="Wrestlers" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Protagoras was one of these sophists, the most famous of his time.  His treatise <em>Technique of Eristics</em>, or “Practice of Wranglings” made analogies to wordplay being a <strong>zero-sum game</strong>.  Victory is achieved in one of two conditions: you had to either win, or force your opponent to lose. “<em>To make the weak argument the strong</em>”  was his motto.  And just like a dirty type of war, rules can sometimes become a secondary objective.  Deception, influence, power, greed… anything and everything can and should be used to win.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sophist is one who gains power or money from an apparent but unreal wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="plato--the-logos">Plato &amp; the Logos</h2>
<p>Plato was one of the first of the <em>truth-seekers</em>.  He believed in the <strong>logos</strong>, the existence of one single universal truth of the cosmos.  Logos is the combination of absolute truth, meaning, and a divine reason.  An idea that lived large in the imaginations of the Ancient Greeks. Truth was knowledge of the gods, and the purpose of humans was to find it, and remove the illusions. From his theory spawned the religion of the Pythagoreans, the first mathematicians.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/irrationality/cosmos.jpg" alt="Cosmos" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>And, just like modern mathematics, it is a fusion: science, philosophy, and natural studies became all one. To attain knowledge, <em>true</em> knowledge, was to become a small step closer to the divine.</p>

<p>***** 
To Plato and his followers, sophists became villains. He lived in a world filled with them, watching them squabble for scraps of influence and status. None of them cared about the actual truth, only their own selfish desires.  Avarice, power, money, ego, influence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A single selfish individual can beat a single altruistic individual, but a group of altruistic individuals can beat a group of selfish individuals.  E.O. Wilson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And legend says this is when the ancestral line of <em>philosophers</em> became divergent from the <em>sophists</em>.  Just like in Star Wars, how the Jedi and Sith became ideologically divergent, despite using the same cosmic force. The underlying motivation leads to a light or a darkness.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/irrationality/star-wars-light-dark.jpg" alt="Star Wars" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>From Plato’s simple idea came a philosophical renaissance that lasted for several centuries: the Stoics, Mathematics, Epicureans, Pythagoreans, the Gospel of John and the creation of Christianity.  This simple idea broke the world and created a new one in its wake.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/irrationality/plato-philosophers.jpg" alt="Platonic Philosophers" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Reason became the guiding force, and when reason is the primary drive of a culture, trust will follow, and great leaders will rise. Students such as Alexander and Marcus Aurelius, the five great emperors and the Pax Romana. To the Romans, Plato was a divine figure, applications of his philosophy led to great strides in engineering and leadership. All a result of the culture that Plato created, the creation of the Philosopher Kings.</p>

<p>Modern science seeks to avoid bias, always afraid of it.  The ancients stare it in the face and see it for what it is. Bias is like many pieces of the human mind, useful if you know how to command it. From Plato’s Cave:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The true pilot must of necessity pay attention to the seasons, the heavens, the stars, the winds, and everything proper to the craft if he is really to rule a ship. - The Republic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>***** </p>

<h1 id="the-dark-ages-and-the-fall-of-reason">The Dark Ages and the Fall of Reason</h1>

<p>The causes behind the fall of the Roman Empire continues to be a topic of debate among historians. Most would agree, like many things, it was never truly one reason, but many that accumulate over time.</p>

<p>Most credit the beginning of the end from the death of Marcus Aurelius, at the end of the Pax-Romana. Marcus Aurelius was the last of the five great Emperors.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/irrationality/marcus-aurelius.jpeg" alt="marcus-aurelius" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>No one knew it at the time, but this came the beginnings of the <em>Crisis of the Third Century</em>.  It was a bad time to be a Roman.  Emperors were being coronated subsequently assassinated, repeat etc.   Civil wars were being fought between rival generals seeking land and power.  To pay for this, generals and emperors gave massive bonuses to their armies, which caused runaway inflation.</p>

<p>Does this sound familiar?  The <em>sophists</em> were returning.  Avarice, power, money, influence. The base human desires which made people fight for scraps at a table. Except here was not a fight with words, but armies, swords, and poison. Truth took a backseat, and trust eroded.  The empire became the ancient equivalent of a modern day toxic workplace.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/irrationality/library-of-alexandria.jpg" alt="Burning of the Library at Alexandria" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>And outside influences, which may have been controlled in a cohesive empire, began to see opportunities in the chaos.  The decline of Rome seemed to be inevitable to everyone, outside and in, and a wave of barbarian tribes began to settle in their lands.</p>

<p>So they did what most would, adapt, by fracturing the Empire and taking control of areas that were easiest/richest to maintain.  <em>Cutting your losses.</em></p>

<p>And with the fall of the Western Roman Empire began the <em>Dark Ages</em>, a period of history where knowledge and philosophy took a backseat.  Critical thinking, stoic leadership, and truth-seeking no longer became intertwined with Roman values and culture. Humanity became lost, truth became unimportant, trust faded. Anti-science fell over the earth.</p>
