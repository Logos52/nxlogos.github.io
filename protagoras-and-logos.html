                    <h2 id="protagoras--the-sophists">Protagoras &amp; the Sophists</h2>
<p>In the 5th century BCE, Greece was populated by <em>sophists</em>: people  trained in the art of persuasion and influence.  They are often paid large sums of money by politicians and leaders, in order to teach them the ways and methods on how to effectively command and influence others.</p>

<p>Protagoras was one of these sophists, the most famous of his time.  His treatise <em>Technique of Eristics</em>, or “Practice of Wranglings” made analogies to wordplay being a <strong>zero-sum game</strong>.  Victory is achieved in one of two conditions: you had to either win, or force your opponent to lose. “To make the weak argument the strong.”  Was his motto.  And just like a dirty type of war, rules can sometimes become a secondary objective.  Deception, influence, power, greed… anything and everything can and should be used to win.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sophist is one who gains power or money from an apparent but unreal wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="plato--the-logos">Plato &amp; the Logos</h2>
<p>Plato was one of the first of the <em>truth-seekers</em>.  He believed in the <strong>logos</strong>, the existence of one, single, universal, truth of the cosmos.  In modern terms, this idea fused together the arts of science, philosophy, and mathematics all into one simple idea. You can think of it as the ancient equivalent of the modern Physicists’ Grand Quest for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything">Theory of Everything</a>.</p>

<p>Plato lived in a world where he watched these <em>sophists</em> squabble for scraps of influence, status, and other such insignificant things. It must have felt like watching animals in a zoo.  You can see how this idea gained mass appeal, for some people are just not so interested in fighting. In comparison to this divine truth, this knowledge of the gods, mortal affairs began to look increasingly insignificant. Philosophers began to invoke this <em>logos</em> the same way that Star Wars uses <em>the force</em>, because absolute truth was considered knowledge of the gods.</p>

<p>And legend says this is when the ancestral line of <em>philosophers</em> began to diverge from the <em>sophists</em>.  Like Jedi being ideologically divergent from the Sith.  From Plato’s simple statement came a renaissance of ideas: the Stoics, Mathematics, Epicureans, Pythagoreans, the Gospel of John.  This simple idea broke the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The philosopher is one who seeks wisdom and truth above all things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logos(Greek) -&gt; Ratio(Latin) -&gt; Reason(English)</p>

<p>Most philosophers believe that reason itself was not always locked inside human minds… rather, it permeates and gives shape to the order of the universe.</p>

<p>When truth is the ultimate goal of a debate, there are no losers.  The truth is a <strong>win-win</strong> for everyone.</p>

<p>As Plato’s followers grew, they began to recognize the absurdity of the sophists’ arguments.  <em>Sophisms</em> they called it, little explosions.  Smoke bombs, distractions, set off to confuse or stun others, in order to advance their own interests. This became what logicians call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion">Principle of Explosion</a>, <em>Ex falso sequitur quadlibet</em>, from false, anything follows.</p>

<p>Does this sound familiar?  Fake news, misinformation, we are literally drowning in it.</p>

<p>Even in high school debate teams across the U.S., we prize influence and persuasion over the truth. It’s been so entrenched in our culture as to go unchallenged for several decades.</p>

<p>The way to see is to go deeper than the arguments themselves.  How do you uncover the truth?  The question lies inside each person’s heart, that motivation that drives them.  What is it they advocate?  Is it the truth? Or something else…</p>
