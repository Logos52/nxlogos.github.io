Keywords: science, analysis, logic, rationality,</p>

<p>This is a blog about <em>Applied Critical Thinking</em>, and <em>Scientific Literacy</em>, or how to think like a scientist. It is largely a personal website, with ideas that have helped me in some ways. I draw from lessons learned as a military analyst, red teamer, and data scientist.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is currently undergoing a renaissance in terms of training everyone down the line to make better decisions. Gone are the days of <em>do it cause I told you to</em>, the threats of the world change too fast.</p>

<p>The older generation of military may scoff at this: the soldier’s rifle is no longer the most important weapon on the battlefield… instead it’s the versatility of the human mind. This is both a great strength and critical weakness.</p>

<p>For the U.S. Military, the future is fought in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Dimension_Operations">five-dimensions</a>. Land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace.  However, with recent events, there is a small movement of those who advocate the defining of the <em>sixth-dimension</em>, or the battle for the human mind.</p>

<p>This is a battle we fight every day as Americans, in a battleground of our own making. If history is any guide, you can fight a war with inferior technology and still win.  <em>However</em>, if you fight with outdated doctrines and practices, you will most assuredly set yourself up for failure.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h3>

<p><img src="./images/reza.jpg" alt="Reza" /></p>

<p>Reza Maakheru is a pen name, in order to create a degree of separation from my personal life. It’s not for personal glory or money, but to start a conversation about the scientific mind in a way that makes more sense than what we’re currently used to in America.</p>

<p>You can reach out on Facebook for my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jay.cantimbuhan">real name</a>, it’s not secret. To expand on before, I’m a former U.S. Military Analyst who served as part of the Global War on Terror in 2010.  I have degrees in Intelligence Analysis, Mathematics, Statistics, and Philosophy.  My most formative time was with the <a href="https://usacac.army.mil/organizations/ufmcs-red-teaming">University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies</a>, where I trained in red-teaming, critical thinking, and asymmetric analysis.</p>

<h3 id="the-case-for-applied-critical-thinking-act">The Case for Applied Critical Thinking (ACT)</h3>
<p><br />
<img src="./images/socrates.jpg" alt="Socrates" style="float: right;margin-left: 5px" />
The past few years have shown the world is infested with “infodemics.” Ideas and fake news spread, like viruses, to vulnerable populations, as a result of automation and microtargeting.</p>

<p>Social sciences have known this: humans are wired to respond to emotional triggers by sharing misinformation, if it reinforces their existing beliefs.</p>

<p>Optimism made designers think that connecting the world would create tolerance and destroy hate. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/misinformation-has-created-a-new-world-disorder/">Technology does not change who we are fundamentally, it only maps onto existing human characteristics.</a></p>

<p>This is where <em>critical thinking</em> comes in. The military’s leaders utilize it the same as any self-defense skill. Being able to actively defend against bad ideas will ensure you will always be the agent of your own mind.  A wrong idea implanted inside your mind can turn you into an agent of the enemy.</p>

<p>ACT is one of the most important mental techniques that military commanders learn in the US, in order to keep their minds agile and prepared.  It comes with side effects too, such as a pragmatic type of scientific literacy, and reduction of bias.</p>

<p>The wars of tomorrow are not like the ones we’ve had in the past. They will be faster, complex, more ambiguous. We are currently part of a world that is advancing faster than we as humans individually are capable of adapting to it.</p>

<p>Whatever occurs, there are always optimal paths.. ones that maximize the probability of successes and minimize the probability of failures.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="lt-principles">LT Principles</h2>

<p>There are a lot of blogs out there, with varying degrees of quality.  So I must try to free myself from sort of “ulterior motives,” which is a key driver of misinformation.</p>

<h4 id="1-good-faith">1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith">Good Faith</a></h4>

<p>A “sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction.”</p>

<p>Some time ago, information dissemination was considered to be a sacred duty. Ancient Greek philosophers understood that information can be used to advance a special interest and “win.” The <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist">sophist</a></em> became a derogatory term for anyone using words to further this type of selfish interest.  Sophists make their living through deception, where philosophers seek wisdom and the truth.</p>

<p>Bad information can cause irreparable harm and even lead to deaths.  With this in mind, writers have a responsibility to make sure they operate on Good Faith.</p>

<h4 id="2-free-of-ego">2. Free of Ego</h4>
<p>My identity is not secret.  All of us want to be recognized, but it’s not the core of my beliefs.  My goal is to be the kind of person I needed when I was younger. A guide for the lost.  The person who I am is not as important as the message.</p>

<p>Some website authors plaster their face on their blogs and articles in a big personal advertisement, “hire me!  I’m important!”  Is the message they’re trying to communicate.</p>

<h4 id="3-free-of-avarice">3. Free of Avarice</h4>
<p>I have no monetization, but haven’t ruled out the possibility of finding something in the future, as long as it is a symbiotic, win-win type of situation, so never any annoying popups or ads.</p>

<p>While coding this website, I have run into situations where I’d be following a tutorial from hackernoon, and halfway down, I find it’s an advertisement for some software product they are trying to sell.</p>

<p>Avarice is a real problem in America right now… There’s both backlash and push in that direction.  Like other Americans, I am averse to it. There are some examples of this in a runaway effect: health care system and college education, to name a few.  Economists call it the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-class_squeeze">squeeze</a></em>.</p>

<h4 id="4-free-of-specialization">4. Free of Specialization</h4>
<p>There’s a lot of advice on how to run a blog… But it is almost always:  pick a niche.  Unfortunately, as an analyst I’m meant to be transdisciplinary. I have had many jobs, and wide sorts of experience that coalesce into being a generalist.</p>

<p>Yes it’s true this blog is about rationality and analysis.  But applications apply to literally anything and everything involving information… so by its nature, it is impossible to specialize. I can equally talk about religion, politics, the economy, history, and people. As long as it’s done in a properly analytic way, free from bias, nothing is off-limits.  I am definitely and most assuredly wrong about many things, but that’s part of the fun of being an analyst. To be wrong is to learn.</p>

<p>I encourage a conversation, but if you have emotions, or an <em>I know better than you</em> type of attitude, I won’t find it engaging. Emotions are clouds to a clear mind.  And even experts can be susceptible to Dunning-Kreuger.</p>

<h1 id="frequenty-asked-questions">Frequenty Asked Questions:</h1>

<h3 id="what-is-logos-history--etymology">What is Logos? History &amp; Etymology</h3>
<p><br />
Logos is the greek word for <em>word</em>, <em>reason</em>, or <em>plan</em>.  In a sense, it is all of these definitions together, a word that doesn’t exist in the English language. The closest form is <em>logic.</em></p>

<p>Logos is the source code that all of science seeks to uncover. Which is why you usually find the root word at the end of truth-seeking disciplines. Sociology, epidemiology, technology, ecology…</p>

<p>In the time of the ancient greeks, this was elevated to the idea of a divine reason, transcending all religions. Absolute truths about the world are considered knowledge of the gods.  This is closest thing the predominantly atheistic Greek philosophers had to a unifying spiritual truth.</p>

<p><img src="./images/cosmos.jpg" alt="Cosmos" style="float: right;margin: 5px" />In today’s time, there are many scientists, such as Carl Sagan and Neil Degrasse Tyson, who do have sacred beliefs. They have a spiritualistic idea of the “cosmos.”  Everything that was, is and will be. Scientists look to it with a divine reverence, the closest thing they have to a religion.   However, this cosmos is inherently chaotic.  The <em>logos</em> is the guiding force, the <em>word</em>, <em>reason</em>, and <em>plan</em>, that gives the <em>cosmos</em> its form and meaning.  The final truth that all scientists strive to get closer towards, with each experiment and each theory.  Its divine reverence has been lost through the ages…</p>

<h3 id="isnt-logos-a-biblical-concept--why-are-you-using-a-religious-concept-for-a-science-website">Isn’t Logos a biblical concept?  Why are you using a religious concept for a science website?</h3>
<p><br />
<img src="./images/plato.jpg" alt="Plato" style="float: left;margin: 5px" />It’s both science and religious. Logos was central to Platonic philosophy, a set of ideas which predate the Bible by ~500 years. Plato was considered to be a divine figure in the Roman Empire. When the Bible was written, it drew heavy influences from Platonic Philosophy. The Book of John tied together Plato’s “Logos”, arguing that Jesus was the manifestation of this truth made flesh.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” - John 1:1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gospel’s original language was Greek, and the Word in it’s translation is Logos. There is no direct translation from Greek to English for the <strong>Word</strong>, so this has always been a source of contention on how best to translate it, with some editions just using the word itself.</p>

<p><img src="./images/God_the_Geometer.jpg" alt="God the Geometer" style="float: right;margin: 5px" />Philosophers argue if you keep it’s original definition in mind, from a metaphorical perspective, the Book of John starts to come alive and read like a work of philosophy.  This Gospel is a primary reason why many people who are both scientists and christians have no problems claiming to be both.</p>

<p>In today’s terms, we think the ideas of science and Christianity are mutually exclusive sets, because we focus too much on the points of contention. But in the venn diagram of ideas, these two have a surprisingly larger overlap than most people believe…</p>

<h3 id="are-you-religious">Are you religious?</h3>
<p>I am not. But I do not consider myself atheist, because the title implies a sort of militancy against religion I don’t share.  The closest title would be agnostic, and abstain from all religions. However, it is my strong personal belief that religion and science are not an either/or type of thing. The two sets have intersections that are bigger than most people believe it to be.  This is true for all religions… there is timeless knowledge each one can teach, if you know how to eliminate your personal biases and dogmatic beliefs, and learn how to consider it with a clearer head.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-purpose">What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>My goal is to identify outdated systems of thinking, and start a discussion on truths that doens’t exist in the current world we live in. And to do it in a way that’s free from political bias and the <em>should’s</em> type thinking that serves as a divider.</p>

<p>We’re currently running buggy, oudated software, susceptible to hackers and anyone who knows how to pull the right strings. The goal isn’t to always be right, but instead to be less wrong.</p>

<p>We all have outdated principles and thinking, none of us are perfect.  It’s just an uncontestible truth.  And there are examples of this all over history.  The Romans, for example, with all their engineering ingenuity, believed chickens were sacred prophets, and brought chickens witht hem on every military campaign. Even the most senior military generals yielded their decisions to the signs and prophecies of chickens. Ignoring them would bring horrible misfortune.</p>

<p>We may laugh today, but back then, that was just the reality of the times. Perhaps there is a future where our descendants would look at us and laugh just as hard, because we choose to get all of our information from biased news sources…</p>
