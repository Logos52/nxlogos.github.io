                <p>This is a personal collection of materials I’ve found to be formative over the years… books, videos, and articles which have become a valuable part of my life in some way.  I consider these to be masterpieces of information.  Life changing advice.</p>

<p>I often go back and revisit these pieces.  Sometimes for guidance, or inspiration on how to live the best life.  These things have shaped my mind immensely, and I do my best to live my life according to these principles.</p>

<p>This is a perpetual work in progress, I will add and subtract as I learn more things.</p>

<p>Disclaimer:  I will add some of these as affiliate links. They are no cost to you, if you would like to support me and find them useful.  As per principle #2, this is currently my only source of monetization. I hope you find them as formative as I have!</p>

<h2 id="the-red-team-handbook---the-armys-guide-to-making-better-decisions">The Red Team Handbook - The Army’s Guide to Making Better Decisions</h2>
<p>The Red Team Leadership Course, administered by University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies, began a cascade of learning and lit a spark which served as the basis for this blog and my life as a whole.</p>

<p>This handbook represents only a small subset of what I’ve learned, but it’s a great starter pack if you are going to go down the road of thinking about the world as a military commander.</p>

<p>Empowering all soldiers to make better decisions is at the core of U.S. military doctrine.  <em>Critical thinking</em> is a defensive skill…  We live in a world where the wrong information can turn you to become an agent of the enemy.</p>

<p>America has encountered several catastrophic failures in recent memory, many of which are due to faulty decision making processes on a system-wide level. To name just a few: the Challenger Disaster, the Bay of Pigs, the 2016 Presidential Election, and American’s response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The Red Teams were designed as a way to mitigate these, by providing an opposing viewpoint.  The <em>enemy</em> comes in many forms, some invisible, some insidious.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why America’s military is always at the forefront of technology?  It’s not just their tech, but also their education on decision making capabilities required to always stay one step ahead of any threat.

<h2 id="yuval-noah-harari-trilogy---sapiens-homo-deus-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century">Yuval Noah Harari Trilogy - Sapiens, Homo Deus, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century</h2>

<p>If I had to choose one book to recommend, 21 Lessons would be the most important book that we need as a human race.  But Sapiens has the most special place in my heart.  It’s the one that most changed my perspective about the world.</p>

<p>With a clear vision of us humans, it teaches us that we are all products of our ideas. Our collective ideas as a community, then as a species, freed us from the chains of the slow process of evolution.  Human minds and ideas, and importantly, our adaptability to changing circumstances, made us become masters of the planet.  But what is next from here? Human minds are a dangerous weapon.. one that can work against us just as much as for us.</p>

<h2 id="subtle-art-of-not-giving-f---mark-manson">Subtle Art of Not Giving F* - Mark Manson</h2>

<p>To be honest, when I saw this book in the stores, the cursing made me give this book a hard pass.  I find that anyone who has to use curses in order to get their point across is usually not in a clear-headed state of mind.</p>

<p>But I am happy and delighted to be mistaken.  This book embraces our tendencies of who we are, complete with all of our bias and emotions, and teaches us that we have the power to turn off the ones that don’t serve us, and turn up the one’s that do.  Humans’ faulty tendencies, will tend to lead us down dark paths, it is true.  But these faults can be turned on its head, just with a little bit of self-awareness.  It’s a classic case of turning your weaknesses into strengths.</p>

<h2 id="the-design-of-everyday-things---don-norman">The Design of Everyday Things - Don Norman</h2>

<p>Sapiens was to humans as this book is to the stuff humans create.  This book teaches us that design is an art.. meant to improve the lives of humans.</p>

<p>The best design often goes unnoticed, and taken for granted.  Because it improves the lives of us so well we don’t even notice it’s there.</p>

<p>But bad design… many people tend to accept as just a normal thing.  Doors for example, every time someone pushes a door that’s mean to be pulled, we often laugh and blame the person, and that person blames himself too.  But the fact that someone had a problem with it is not the human’s fault, it’s the door for being designed badly.</p>

<p>This problem goes far beyond doors however, you see badly designed systems everywhere.</p>

<h2 id="the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up---marie-kondo">The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up - Marie Kondo</h2>

<p><em>One book to define minimalism</em>, is what this is.  Marie Kondo brings together timeless elements of Shinto and spiritualism to another level, by explaining that our lives and environment are products of each other, spiritually entwined.  At the heart of it is a positive cyclical process:  you affect environment —&gt; environment affects you.  And vice versa.
We can unlock more of what we want to become, by being deliberate in what we choose to surround ourselves with.
And the best part is that, as we let go of the things that don’t have a place in our lives, we must do so with a sense of gratitude, and say goodbye in a proper way.  In the same way we as humans will send off the spirits of the dead.</p>

<h2 id="jack-bogle---bogleheadsorg-and-vanguardcom">Jack Bogle - bogleheads.org and vanguard.com</h2>

<p>Jack Bogle <em>shouldn’t</em> need any introduction, but he is the inventor and pioneer of the low-cost index fund, and revolutionized investing in America as we know it.</p>

<p>Investing is one of the more powerful things about living in America, there are many paths to it.  Many people talk about offensively going after money, such as chasing it, getting the highest salary possible.  But not many talk about the defensive options.. the security and preparation against threats and shocks to the economy, and the ways to make the money work in your favor and grow.</p>

<p>His simple low-cost index funds turned Wall Street on it’s head, a culture which continues to chase short-term investment gains at the expense of long-term value.</p>

<p>What Jack taught us is that in the world of finance, you don’t have to become a millionaire, and there are other options besides the never-ending chase for more wealth.  You can live simply, safely, and within your means, and have a happy fulfilling life.</p>

Other Notes:
If you are stuck with <em>paralysis analysis</em> of which index funds to invest in, I’ll share with you a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/g19uil/ok_to_just_own_vtsax_through_my_30s/">comment from Bogleheads reddit</a>in response to a question about going 100% into Vanguard Fund VTSAX:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>95% of success comes from saving aggressively and investing it. The remaining 5% is down to investment strategy which is highly individual based on circumstances and risk profile.</p>

  <p>Is all VTSAX in your 30’s ok? Yes. Is all VTSAX your whole life ok? Yes. Is a 60/40 stock and bonds allocation ok? Yes. Can I go aggressive while accumulating and nearing retirement build a bond tent? Yes. Is something else ok? Yes.</p>
