&lt;p&gt;It’s very easy for most people to dismiss them as being “dumb,” or “ill-informed,” but the reality is that conspiracy theorists are only human, like you and me, with the same capabilities of thought as everyone else.  Be careful of thinking they are different and you are the smart one, because it’s the same type of hubris they themselves have for you and your thoughts.  If you look a little bit deeper, you will find we have more similarities than differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all fall victim to our own minds sometimes.  Recognizing our own brain’s weaknesses is the best way to defend ourself from that.  Everyone believes in one at some point. Even the world’s preeminent scientists. (That later) Chances are you currently believe at least one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no way we can eliminate them entirely, our minds are meaning-factories, it’s our nature. But with a little forethought, we can at least make sure the worst ones go extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-believe-them&quot;&gt;Why Do We Believe Them?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-confidence--unsupervision&quot;&gt;1. Confidence + Unsupervision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/ct/dunning-kruger.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dunning-Kruger&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;
Also known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kreuger Effect&lt;/a&gt;, operating together with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence&quot;&gt;hierarchy of competence&lt;/a&gt;.  These are famous biases where people with low ability tend to &lt;em&gt;overestimate&lt;/em&gt; their ability, because of their inability to recognize their own lack of ability.  &lt;em&gt;Unskilled and Unaware of It&lt;/em&gt;, was the title of Kreuger &amp;amp; Dunning’s famous paper.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/ct/hierarchy-of-competence.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hierarchy of Competence&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #ccc; margin-top: 1.5em;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is the Hierarchy of Competence, which goes for all skills.  Most people are unconscious of their incompetence, and this applies to almost every human skill, which includes reading about news and current events.  People assume because they read every day, they can see the world, but there is no correcting mechanism to supervise if you are right or wrong. This plus confidence will lead people to assume they are right about every conclusion they come to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-sometimes-they-are-true&quot;&gt;2. Sometimes They Are True&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/ct/snowden-film.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Snowden&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;There are many examples of this, just from my home country of America:  Watergate, Project Sunshine, MK-Ultra, and NSA mass surveillance.  The fact that some are true may lead others to a very rational conclusion that others can true as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-unfalsifiable&quot;&gt;3. Unfalsifiable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einstein is famously quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;%20https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability&quot;&gt;Faisifiability&lt;/a&gt; is a core scientific principle that states, science only needs one good (&lt;em&gt;repeatable&lt;/em&gt;) experiment in order to disprove an entire scientific theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with most conspiracy theories is that many of them are unfalsifiable, with no way to disprove them.  But this isn’t the case with all of them.  Many have been and can be easily falsified by science, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth&quot;&gt;Flat Earth Theory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccines_and_autism&quot;&gt;Vaccines Cause Autism&lt;/a&gt;.  These easily falsifiable theories will hold weight from a segment of the population, due to a lack of understanding of &lt;em&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/em&gt;.  But, falsifying a fact and falsifying a belief are two separate things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-confirmation-bias--the-youtube-algorithm&quot;&gt;4. Confirmation Bias &amp;amp; the YouTube Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All humans have a tendency to search for and interpret information that confirms their existing beliefs. Once you believe something, it becomes part of your personality, and difficult to dislodge.   This is feeded into by the YouTube Algorithm.  Designed to keep you on the platform for a long time, it  will feed you more information you are likely to click on, further solidifying your beliefs.
	This deserves an entire article of it’s own…  it’s currently one of the biggest problems facing America…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;three-scientific-explanations&quot;&gt;Three Scientific Explanations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-evolutionary-theory&quot;&gt;1. Evolutionary Theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early humans, our lives were often violent and dangerous.  The entertainment we enjoy today, such as&lt;em&gt; horror movies&lt;/em&gt;, are a direct result of dangers we used to individually face, which is why we are always attracted to them, to try and imagine ourselves in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horror movies use the same tricks that early humans face.  Our observations vs. our reality.  Most times, our observations and reality line up.  But other times, not so, and we call this &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt; comes in two forms, scientists call them:  &lt;strong&gt;Type I&lt;/strong&gt;  and &lt;strong&gt;Type II&lt;/strong&gt;.
Imagine we ourselves are in a horror movie.  &lt;strong&gt;Type II Error&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when, for example, we are in a dark room, and look into the mirror.  We expect to see a ghost.  Oooooooo!  So we look, and OMG!  We see.. ourselves.  No ghost.  Well that’s embarassing, but everything’s fine.
&lt;strong&gt;Type I Error&lt;/strong&gt; is when we think, hey there’s no ghost.  So whatever.  We look in the mirror, and BAM!  The girl from The Ring comes out and kills us.  We’re dead.  Oh crap.
Type I Errors are called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_scare&quot;&gt;jump scares&lt;/a&gt; in the film industry.  People think of it as just a cheap trick, but the evolutionary equivalent of jump scares have real, serious consequences, such as being eaten by a crocodile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As humans, we are constantly on the lookout to avoid a Type I Error.  &lt;em&gt;Better safe than sorry&lt;/em&gt;.   It’s better to be mentally prepared for a threat that may not exist, rather than be unprepared for one that does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-pareidolia&quot;&gt;2. Pareidolia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pareidolia is the &lt;em&gt;tendency of perceiving stimulus, of a pattern or object, as something known to the observer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/ct/orion-constellation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orion&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; /&gt;
From the Greek word &lt;em&gt;para&lt;/em&gt; (“alongside”), and &lt;em&gt;eidolon&lt;/em&gt; (“image, shape”).  Everytime you see an elephant in the clouds, or a man’s face on the moon, that’s your pareidolia speaking. All humans have this, and it’s not confined to humans, even computers being trained in pattern recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cognitive bias that all humans are susceptible to.  The tendency to find patterns in the chaos, even if those patterns don’t exist. when Jesus appears on a piece of toast, it’s a holy sign. When a face appears on the Martian surface, it’s the aliens.  But what is the sign when you show them the map of Italy, and you see a boot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-probability&quot;&gt;3. Probability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability is the scientific way of dealing with uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a famous 2013 paper, &lt;em&gt;“Measuring Belief in Conspiracy Theories”&lt;/em&gt; a physicist tried to calculate the likelihood of conspiracy theories based on the &lt;em&gt;total number of people required to keep it secret&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which led to the creation of the a &lt;em&gt;Generic Conspiracist Beliefs&lt;/em&gt; scale.  His findings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moon Landing: 411,000 people ending in 3.68 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climate Change: 405,000 people ending in 3.70 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vaccination: minimum 22,000 people (without drug companies) ending between 3.15~34.78 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cure for Cancer: 714,000 people  ending in 3.17 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flat Earth wasn’t studied, but just by using a thought experiment, you can tell it’s probably the least likely.  You would need the cooperation of all major governments, airlines, pilots, Armed Forces, Aerospace Companies, NASA, SpaceX, and not to mention the entire scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging the likelihood is similar to what we should be doing as humans, but many of us reduce these beliefs to absolute truth or falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called the &lt;strong&gt;Bias of Absolutes&lt;/strong&gt;.   If someone else has coined this already (which is entirely a likely possibility), I will correct this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to think in terms of absolute  thinking, but nothing at all is 100% absolute. Even the laws of physics can be up-ended in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that probability can work &lt;em&gt;to the advantage of&lt;/em&gt; some conspiracy theories.  In 2003, Nick Bostrom, a famous Oxford Philosopher, successfully convinced the entire scientific community, just by using Bayesian Probability and some key assumptions, that we are all likely to be living in an artificial simulation.  This is the famous &lt;em&gt;simulation hypothesis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-so-and-so-conspiracy-theory-true&quot;&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;so and so&lt;/em&gt; conspiracy theory true?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all things, it depends on the factors. Just remember the &lt;em&gt;Bias of Absolutes&lt;/em&gt;. All theories are never 100% certain, just varying degrees of likelihood. Evidence &amp;gt; anecdotal. Science &amp;gt; your YouTube video. As long as you are aware of your own cognitive biases, it can be fun to entertain the possibilities. The danger is when we take them too seriously at the expense of proven science, such as in the case of Anti-Vaxxers, or the drinking of Bleach during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The wrong information provided to vulnerable people can lead to serious harm, even death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, for most, entertaining conspiracy theories is enjoyable in the same way people like to look at optical illusions.  To close, here are some personal favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

The story is well known among the mathematics circles.  Hippasus lived in the 5th century BCE who belonged to a religious sect called the &lt;em&gt;Pythagoreans&lt;/em&gt;, who believed that rational numbers are the heart of the universe.  &lt;em&gt;All is number&lt;/em&gt;, was their motto.  Numbers were at the heart of the divine &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; truth, and Pythagoreans believed they were sacred, &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; things, that held together the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came Hippasus, a follower and practitioner of this religion.  He was able to solve the mystery of the diagonal of the square.  If you take a square, each with sides 1, the diagonal will be \(\sqrt{2}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, \(\sqrt{2}\) is the first irrational number in existence to be proved, and the pythagoreans, while based on a mathematical religion, is still a religion, with belief systems.  The discovery and existence of an irrational number was considered a form of heresy and a threat to the core of the Pythagoreans, who’s power and influence stemmed from their belief that rational numbers are sacred.  Instead of being rewarded for his discovery, he was murdered.. thrown into the open sea by his sect-mates.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This serves as a cautionary tale for anyone who is interested in the study of rationality, as well as science.  The world has many of these dark twins… a light and a darkness. One cannot exist without the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the best way to study science, you must acknowledge its dark sides, and go to places that even science does not care to look. In pursuit for the never-ending quest for truth, scientists often turn a blind eye to threats to its existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, science suffers from the same confirmation bias that antiscience does. They will discuss among themselves how wrong and misguided the other side is. When there is no shared ground, when science does not include everyone, lines will be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the person on the fringes, science is the enemy. It’s the teacher that gave you a ‘D’ in math. It’s the exclusionary Ivy-League elite universities. ‘Only the smart study here. You don’t study here, so what are you?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any isolated person that finds themselves disenfranchised will find company in each other. Movements will build, communities will form, and they, like any community, will take to the streets and fight for their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History is filled with examples of this: the burning of the library at Alexandria, the ending of the Islamic scientific Golden Age, the 800 years of what we call the Dark Ages… Science has encountered massive destruction in it’s history.  Knowledge gained, and knowledge lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a belief system ignores the outside world, that belief system will suffer the inevitable fate of becoming consumed by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hubris to think that we are immune from the sins of the past, for we are all humans, no different from our ancestors, complete with the same emotions, cognitive bias, and belief systems. Things that have happened, will happen again…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/irrationality/library-of-alexandria.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Burning of the Library at Alexandria&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I first heard of this story after reading Irrationality: The Dark Side of Reason, by Justin E.H. Smith.  It’s a solid read that explains how our pursuit of rationality often unconvers its opposite. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It should be noted the actual details from story of Hippasus are subject of historical debate.  This is legend, and, like other legends, begins with some basis in truth, but becomes distorted over each telling of the story, like a game of telephone.  Among contemporary mathematicians it is a well-known tale, the origins of which can be traced back to the Pythagoreans themselves. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Quantum physics, expanding universe, each of which falls so far out of philosophy that the whole community of philosophers were rendered essentially obsolete. - Neil Degrasse  Tyson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to any school’s website they have a section “Why Study Philosophy?”  They make arguments how studying philosophy has real practical benefits, such as helping you become a better thinker, to analyze problems logically, and to write and speak clearly.  There are also arguments that philosophy has made advancements and contributed immensely to society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arguments are a form of information called “&lt;em&gt;technically the truth&lt;/em&gt;.” The writers did not necessarily have bad intent, they are just trying to declare their relevancy in a world that fights against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young, 19 year old, I read a webpage like this at my undergraduate, which subsequently led to a series of events culminating in a B.A. in Philosophy.  At the time, I was a lost college student who was just trying to find a purpose in life.  Four years later, nothing has changed.  It just feels like filled my head with weird things like Metaphysics and Epistemology. What usefulness could I provide to society?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Modern Philosophy is, you are supposed to ask questions, and think about big picture type of things. It is encouraged to &lt;em&gt;ask questions&lt;/em&gt;, and expected to never arrive at the answers.  &lt;em&gt;Repeat to infinity&lt;/em&gt;.  Like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop&quot;&gt;while loop&lt;/a&gt; with no breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the history, philosophy was not intended to be like this.  To the Ancient Greeks, &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt; are&lt;em&gt; just as important&lt;/em&gt; as questions.   Life expectancy was too short to go down long paths, &lt;em&gt;Memento Mori&lt;/em&gt;, remember death, for we all must die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time was a gift.  To the ancients, there was no hope that one day we could &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink&quot;&gt;Neuralink&lt;/a&gt; our brains to the internet, or that one day scientists can learn how to extend our lifespan and eliminate aging.  Death was always there, as inevitable as the changing of seasons and rotation of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, there was no time to fuss about with useless things.  Philosophy was &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt;, and most importantly &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;.  With a great many scientific and military applications. The greatest students have had substantially enhanced capabilities of leadership and critical thinking, such as Alexander the Great and Marcus Aurelius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/mp/lawn-mower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Busywork&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot; /&gt; And compare that to the tradition of today:  &lt;em&gt;If a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Is true beauty subjective or objective?&lt;/em&gt;  The absurdity becomes clear as day.  &lt;strong&gt;Who cares?&lt;/strong&gt; Modern philosophy is what we call in the military &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_work&quot;&gt;busywork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, useful to society as mowing your lawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***** &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-it-travel-so-far-from-its-ancient-roots&quot;&gt;How did it travel so far from its ancient roots?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many systems, changes were a result of small, rational decisions, all of which made sense at the time. The problems are multi-factored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;problem-1--committment-bias&quot;&gt;Problem 1:  Committment Bias&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a trend you may have witnessed yourself: in general, the people to advocate the relevance of philosophy are usually students and learners of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Committment bias&lt;/em&gt; is the tendency to rationalize your past decisions, rather than go down another path, even when faced with increasing evidence.  Similar to &lt;em&gt;confirmation bias.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/mp/nokia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nokia&quot; style=&quot;width: 150px&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;“&lt;em&gt;This is the way it’s always been done&lt;/em&gt;” therefore “&lt;em&gt;this is the way it has to be&lt;/em&gt;”  Modern philosophy has gone down a road of biased decisions which led to stagnation, while the world marched forward.  Both the bias and its outcome of irrelevance are similar to the story of the Nokia phone company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your principles and thoughts are outdated, so too will be your outcomes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-2-science-is-a-self-correcting-process&quot;&gt;Case 2: Science is a Self Correcting Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science rarely needs to defend itself.  Virtually no one will challenge its power unless it steps over into the realm of another belief system.  Its benefits to society speak for itself, in the words of Richard Dawkins, “it just works.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of many powerful modern scientists who add immense value to society.  Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, Bill Nye, Carl Sagan, Neil Degrasse Tyson.  Philosophers are a little bit more difficult to name, and certainly not elevated to the level of pop culture. Nick Bostrom([^1](#): Nick Bostrom:  a philosopher who embraces science, and who’s simulation argument has successfully convinced the majority of scientific thinkers, using Bayesian Probability, we are likely to be living in a simulation.) is the closest we have to one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can refute science is &lt;em&gt;better science&lt;/em&gt;, based on elimination of biases and reproducible experimentation.  It’s an iterative process and it’s not perfect, but it does tend to produce results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-3-philosophy-should-be-self-correcting-but-its-not&quot;&gt;Case 3: Philosophy &lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; be Self-Correcting (but it’s not)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many cases in history where people believed something, only have those beliefs thrown away with evidence and changing times. Freud for example, was once considered a pop-culture figure.  His ideas were considered so crazy and wrong it motivated people to find a scientific explanation just to prove him wrong.  Similar to the Stack Overflow Bias&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophy is supposed to have this self-correcting mechanism, but when traditions are set it becomes harder to change things.  We should be able to disregard mediocre philosophy and cast out the irrelevant ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Latin word for &lt;strong&gt;decision&lt;/strong&gt; means “to cut off.” The same way Bruce Lee cast aside the irrelevant kick-punch techniques in favor of taking only the most effective.  Or Marie Kondo, saving only your things which &lt;em&gt;spark joy&lt;/em&gt; and showing respectful gratitude for what must go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern philosophy is a hoarder&lt;/strong&gt;, like a grandparent with boxes and boxes of clutter, refusing to throw anything away or even acknowledging there is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/mp/tidying-up.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Marie Kondo&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is encouraged to ask all sorts of questions, but fail to ask the most relevant question of all: &lt;em&gt;is this important?&lt;/em&gt;  But no one wants to get kicked out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this is not 100% the fault of philosophy, it’s a general issue that stretches to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; undergraduate academia.  Adaptive change is slow and iterative, widely dependent on each  department. But this is opening up a can of worms that deserves another article in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-4-bad-writing&quot;&gt;Case 4: Bad Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I know I’m not Shakespeare, but I can tell bad writing the same way most people can tell a bad and good movie. Clarity vs. jargon: clear thoughts, clear mind. Academic writing has this habit of ejaculating words on paper then call it knowledge the same way Jackson Pollack splatters paint on a canvas and call it art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the tendency is to blame the user. &lt;em&gt;You just don’t know enough about it,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;our thoughts are too complicated for normal people to understand.&lt;/em&gt; And because people on the outside are not experts, this belief usually goes unchallenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is the moment of non-construction, disclosing the absentation of actuality from the concept in part through its invitation to emphasize, in reading, the helplessness — rather than the will to power — of its fall into conceptuality. - Paul Fry, A Defense of Poetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things considered normal tend to stay the same.  If it is everywhere, no one even sees a problem. This is not any one person’s fault, it’s systemic. When you live in a bubble, you can’t see problems in relation to the world outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/mp/calvin-hobbes-writing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Calvin and Hobbes - Bad Writing&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-5-falsifiability&quot;&gt;Case 5: Falsifiability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reproducability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;falsifiability&lt;/em&gt; are two central principles of science.  This grounds their work into reality and makes sure that science is always working on something that is practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falsifiability&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most important.  Anyone can come up with a crazy conspiracy theory that is unfalsifiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein is once quoted as saying “a million experiments can prove me right, but all you need is one experiment to prove me wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary philosophy just doesn’t hold this principle … theories continue to circle around questions that don’t have practical answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-why&quot;&gt;But Why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A belief system is like a human, irrelevancy a form of death. When faced with a threat, it will fight to &lt;em&gt;survive.&lt;/em&gt; And, just like humans, when faced with a threat, they must go through evolution or become extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophers are human, they want the same things everyone else does: job security, stability, etc. Each generation must maintain the appearance of doing something necessary, or face their collective extinction. &lt;strong&gt;Busywork&lt;/strong&gt;, a type of pseudo-productivity. This is not a conscious choice, to live in a bubble means your eyes face inward and not out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a human race, we are facing some real, serious, threats…  end of the world type of scenarios. Misinformation, fake news, anti-science… all of which are causing immense harm, and setting us back years, decades, perhaps even centuries of progress.  &lt;em&gt;Where are the truth-seekers?&lt;/em&gt;  Modern philosophers are concerned more with themselves and their special questions without thought to the ones the world needs answers to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophy and science have had the same goal for millennia. &lt;em&gt;Find the truth&lt;/em&gt;.  Every victory of science should be a victory for philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, modern philosophers are concerned more with defending themselves from arguments by scientists saying they are irrelevant.  This is perceived as an attack, but scientists by nature tend to see observable, objective truths. If you have to defend yourself from the observations of scientists, you are probably not yourself seeing objectively…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency. - Ibn al-Haytham, the First Scientist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/irrationality/chess.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chess&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;In the 5th century BCE, Greece was populated by &lt;em&gt;sophists&lt;/em&gt;: people  trained in the art of persuasion and influence.  They are often paid large sums of money by politicians and leaders, in order to teach them the ways and methods on how to effectively command and influence others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/irrationality/wrestlers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wrestlers&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protagoras was one of these sophists, the most famous of his time.  His treatise &lt;em&gt;Technique of Eristics&lt;/em&gt;, or “Practice of Wranglings” made analogies to wordplay being a &lt;strong&gt;zero-sum game&lt;/strong&gt;.  Victory is achieved in one of two conditions: you had to either win, or force your opponent to lose. “&lt;em&gt;To make the weak argument the strong&lt;/em&gt;”  was his motto.  And just like a dirty type of war, rules can sometimes become a secondary objective.  Deception, influence, power, greed… anything and everything can and should be used to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sophist is one who gains power or money from an apparent but unreal wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plato--the-logos&quot;&gt;Plato &amp;amp; the Logos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plato was one of the first of the &lt;em&gt;truth-seekers&lt;/em&gt;.  He believed in the &lt;strong&gt;logos&lt;/strong&gt;, the existence of one single universal truth of the cosmos.  Logos is the combination of absolute truth, meaning, and a divine reason.  An idea that lived large in the imaginations of the Ancient Greeks. Truth was knowledge of the gods, and the purpose of humans was to find it, and remove the illusions. From his theory spawned the religion of the Pythagoreans, the first mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/irrationality/cosmos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cosmos&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, just like modern mathematics, it is a fusion: science, philosophy, and natural studies became all one. To attain knowledge, &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, was to become a small step closer to the divine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***** 
To Plato and his followers, sophists became villains. He lived in a world filled with them, watching them squabble for scraps of influence and status. None of them cared about the actual truth, only their own selfish desires.  Avarice, power, money, ego, influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single selfish individual can beat a single altruistic individual, but a group of altruistic individuals can beat a group of selfish individuals.  E.O. Wilson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And legend says this is when the ancestral line of &lt;em&gt;philosophers&lt;/em&gt; became divergent from the &lt;em&gt;sophists&lt;/em&gt;.  Just like in Star Wars, how the Jedi and Sith became ideologically divergent, despite using the same cosmic force. The underlying motivation leads to a light or a darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/irrationality/star-wars-light-dark.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Star Wars&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Plato’s simple idea came a philosophical renaissance that lasted for several centuries: the Stoics, Mathematics, Epicureans, Pythagoreans, the Gospel of John and the creation of Christianity.  This simple idea broke the world and created a new one in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/irrationality/plato-philosophers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Platonic Philosophers&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His ideas just worked. Students became some of the world’s greatest leaders, such as Alexander and Marcus Aurelius. To the Romans, Plato was a divine figure, applications of his philosophy led to great strides in Engineering and development, and the vast expansion of Rome, holding all of Europe under one cohesive empire, was a direct result of the culture that Plato created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Romans, armed with the culture of philosophy, became great leaders, masters of their own mind, and by proxy, masters of others. Their mental techniques were timeless, producing some of the best critical thinkers, able to see through the fog of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When truth is the ultimate goal of a debate, there are no losers.  The truth is a &lt;strong&gt;win-win&lt;/strong&gt; for everyone. Once you identify truth as the primary motive of an individual, trust will follow.  And trust provides order and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense, the concept of &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; became arguably a more powerful idea than the concept of the modern scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern science seeks to avoid bias, always afraid of it.  The ancients stare it in the face and see it for what it is. Bias is like many pieces of the human mind, useful if you know how to command it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The philosopher is one who seeks wisdom and truth above all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to see is to go deeper than the arguments themselves.  How do you uncover the truth?  The question lies inside each person’s heart, that motivation that drives them.  What is it they advocate?  Is it the truth? Or something else…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***** &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-dark-ages&quot;&gt;The Dark Ages&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fall of the Roman Empire and the start of the Dark Ages, continues to be a topic of debate. Like many things, it was never one reason, but many problems that accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most credit the beginning of the end from the death of the Philosopher-King, Marcus Aurelius, at the end of the Pax-Romana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one knew it at the time, but this came the beginnings of the &lt;em&gt;Crisis of the Third Century&lt;/em&gt;.  It was a bad time to be a Roman.  Emperors were being coronated subsequently assassinated, repeat etc.   Civil wars were being fought between rival generals seeking land and power.  To pay for this, generals and emperors gave massive bonuses to their armies, which caused runaway inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar?  The &lt;em&gt;sophists&lt;/em&gt; were returning.  Avarice, power, money, influence. The base human desires which made people fight for scraps at a table. Except here was not a fight with words, but armies, swords, and poison. Truth took a backseat, and trust eroded.  The empire became the ancient equivalent of a modern day toxic workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./assets/images/irrationality/library-of-alexandria.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Burning of the Library at Alexandria&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And outside influences, which may have been controlled in a cohesive empire, began to see opportunities in the chaos.  The decline of Rome seemed to be inevitable to everyone, outside and in, and a wave of barbarian tribes began to settle in their lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they did what most would, adapt, by fracturing the Empire and taking control of areas that were easiest/richest to maintain.  &lt;em&gt;Cutting your losses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so began the &lt;em&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/em&gt;, a period of history where knowledge and philosophy took a backseat.  Critical thinking, stoic leadership, and truth-seeking no longer became intertwined with Roman values and culture.  Humanity became lost, truth became unimportant, trust  faded. Anti-science swarmed the earth. The sophists had taken over.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reza Maakheru</name></author><category term="getting-started" /><category term="logos" /><category term="sophists" /><category term="philosophy" /><category term="rationality" /><summary type="html">If Platonic philosophy had a villain, it would be Protagoras, of which Plato himself was influenced as an example of what *not* to follow.
