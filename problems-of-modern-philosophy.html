  <p>Quantum physics, expanding universe, each of which falls so far out of philosophy that the whole community of philosophers were rendered essentially obsolete.Philosophy has parted ways from the frontier of the physical sciences, when there was a day they were one and the same.  - Neil Degrasse Tyson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you go to any school’s website they have a section “Why Study Philosophy?”  They make arguments how studying philosophy has real practical benefits, such as helping you become a better thinker, to analyze and solve problems logically, and to write and speak clearly.  There are also arguments that philosophy has made advancements and contributed immensely to society.  But to be honest, these same can be said of just about any type of formal study.</p>

<p>As per my last post, philosophy was never intended to be just “asking a bunch of questions <em>repeat to infinity</em>”, like today.  The <em>answers</em> are<em> just as important</em> as the questions.  Philosophy was, at the time, grounded in practical reality, with real-world scientific and military applications.  Knowledge learned from its techniques have enhanced the capabilities of both entire societies and great leaders, such as Alexander the Great and Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<p>It’s true that even today, the U.S. Military does use a version of philosophy to help in training for its leaders and officers, but they are careful stay away from the title of  <em>philosophy</em>,  because the meaning of that word today.  Instead they draw from anthropology and evasion of biases in order to shape the minds to become more</p>

<p>Philosophy and science were not enemies, they have historically been one and the same. Anything science reveals should be something that philosophy should embrace as another victory for truth and the unraveling of the universe.</p>

<p>But modern philosophy has gone so far from its ancient roots that it is, unfortunately, unrecognizable.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="case-1--confirmation-bias">Case 1:  Confirmation Bias</h3>

<p>It is a strange trend and you may have witnessed this yourself: in general, the only people to advocate a case that philosophy is relevant are students and learners of philosophy themselves.</p>

<p>In that sense, their belief is a type of <em>confirmation bias</em>, similar to that of a religion.  Any religion will attempt to claim its beliefs and studies are relevant to the modern age.</p>

<p>In general, if you need to read an article on “Why Philosophy is Relevant” or “The Benefits of Studying Philosophy,” the articles will have the same amount of bias as a Watchtower Magazine.</p>

<h3 id="case-2-science-is-a-self-correcting-process">Case 2: Science is a Self Correcting Process</h3>

<p>What refutes science is <em>better science</em>.
What does not refute science is feelings, beliefs, religions, or your opinions after watching a Youtube video.
Science rarely needs to defend itself.  Virtually no one will challenge its power unless it steps over into the realm of another belief system.  Its benefits to society speak for itself, in the words of Richard Dawkins, “it just works.”
You can think of many powerful modern scientists who add immense value to society.  Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, Bill Nye, Carl Sagan, Neil Degrasse Tyson.  Philosophers are a little bit more difficult to name, and certainly not elevated to the level of pop culture. Nick Bostrom([^1](#): Nick Bostrom:  a philosopher who embraces science, and who’s simulation argument has successfully convinced the majority of scientific thinkers, using Bayesian Probability, we are likely to be living in a simulation.) is the closest we have to one.</p>

<h3 id="case-3-philosophy-should-be-self-correcting-but-its-not">Case 3: Philosophy <em>Should</em> be Self-Correcting (but it’s not)</h3>

<p>Modern philosophy tends to go far up into the clouds… it tackles some serious questions about life, the nature of things, and consciousness.  But but never arrives anywhere.</p>

<p>At some point, philosophers need to accept that questions are only better when there are practical, “reachable” answers.    When is it enough?</p>

<p>There have been many cases in history where people have believed something, only to be proven true, or be proven false.  Freud was once considered the authority of psychology, but his theories are considered obsolete today.</p>

<p>Philosophy has no such self-correcting mechanism. We should be able to disregard mediocre philosophy the same way we don’t read  the majority of books at the bookstore, or the majority of scholarly papers in academia.</p>

<p>There are people who continue to study outdated philosophical ideas, and just believe them to be important questions. They ask all kinds of questions, but fail to ask the most relevant question of all: <em>is this important?</em>  But no, that’s off limits. No one wants to get kicked out of the classroom.  <em>Because I told you so,</em> or <em>that’s the way it is,</em> or <em>I did it this way, so you should too.</em></p>

<p><strong>Modern Philosophy has become a bureaucracy.</strong>  And when senior leaders of a bureaucracy are unwilling to change and adapt, the whole structure stalls.</p>

<p>To be fair, this is not 100% the fault of philosophy, it’s a general issue that stretches into <em>all</em> undergraduate academia.  Adaptive change has been slow and extremely iterative, widely dependent on each individual department. But this is opening up a can of worms that deserves another article in itself.</p>

<h3 id="case-4-bad-writing">Case 4: Bad Writing</h3>
<p>So, let’s be honest, no one wants to read bad writing, unless they’re making fun of it.  Modern philosophical writing has this bad habit to splatter words on a page and call it philosophy the same way Jackson Pollack splatters paint on a canvas.</p>

<p>And the general tendency is to blame the user.  <em>You just don’t know enough about it,</em> or <em>our thoughts are too complicated for normal people to understand.</em> And because people on the outside are not experts, this belief usually goes unchallenged.</p>

<p>If everyone accepts it as a normal thing, nothing changes.  When you live inside a bubble, you can’t see the mistakes you make in relation to the world outside.  You will likely annoy everyone you try to interact with, and the writing becomes discarded into irrelevancy.</p>

<h3 id="case-5-falsifiability">Case 5: Falsifiability</h3>
<p><em>Reproducability</em> and <em>falsifiability</em> are two central principles of science.  This grounds their work into reality and makes sure that science is always working on something that is practical.
<em>Falsifiability</em> is one of the most important.  Anyone can come up with a crazy conspiracy theory that is unfalsifiable.
Einstein is once quoted as saying “a million experiments can prove me right, but all you need is one experiment to prove me wrong.”  This is what gives some theories power and others not, the fact that you can support or disprove them, and all you need is the correct amount of evidence.
Faisifiability is a core principle of the sciences, the fact that all you need is one solid case to disprove something.
Contemporary philosophy just doesn’t hold this principle … theories continue to circle around questions that don’t have practical answers.  In this sense, they hold just as much weight as unproven conspiracy theories.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="but-why">But Why?</h3>
<p>The answer is the same as any belief system or religion: survival.  In order to maintain their relevance and job security, each generation of philosophers at university needs to maintain the appearance they are doing something important and necessary to society.  It’s a passing of the torch.  Philosophy is no longer a search for truth, it’s a belief system, fighting for survival, morphed into something unrecognizable from its original roots.</p>

<p>In order for modern philosophy to survive, it needs to evolve.. to find a way to fuse itself back in with science….</p>

<p>There are so many, countless, real-world applications philosophy can teach, of which I have learned firsthand as part of the military.  Critical thinking, wargaming, red-teaming…  Protection against groupthink, scientific literacy… An awareness of cognitive bias and how to combat it.  Sun-Tzu, Clausewitz, Marcus Aurelius…</p>

<p>A re-emphasis on self-improvement, of which philosophy was the creator of, in the form of the stoics.  The current U.S. infestation with fake news and bad science, of which philosophy needs to and must take a commanding role.</p>

<p>Instead what does it focus on?  The nature of consciousness.  How do we know what we know?  If a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound?</p>

<p>I realize I’m making some preposterous arguments, and I show my bias against philosophy itself.  But as a human race, we are facing some real, serious, threats…  end of the world type of scenarios.  Misinformation, fake news, antiscience… all of which are causing immense harm, and setting us back years, decades, perhaps centuries of progress.  <em>Where are the truth-seekers?</em>  Our world is being taken over by sophists, and modern philosophers are concerned more with themselves. Philosophy not only needs to embrace science, but be its chief defender against threats.</p>

<p>Instead, modern philosophers are more concerned with defending themselves from arguments by scientists saying they are not relevant.  This is perceived as an attack, but scientists by nature see observable, objective truths.  If you have to defend yourself from the observations of scientists, you are probably not yourself seeing objectively…</p>

<hr />

<p>Disclaimer:  I will say this, I am lumping all of modern philosophy into a basket of “badness,” but there are always exceptions.  Philosophy is not dead, but the one’s that I respect now are ones who have embraced science.</p>

<p>Nick Bostrom is the clearest example of this, who has put forth convincing arguments that we are probably living in a simulation.</p>
